::OpenFrameworks SuperCollider Server Host::

This project shows how to run a SuperCollider server from within the audio callback in openFrameworks (version 007).  It's based on Gerard Roma's SuperColliderAU project.

Usage:  Running this project will start a blank OF app along with a SC server.  You can access the server from the SuperCollider app, where you can build a synthdef graph to generate or process audio. See the SuperColliderAU help file for an example of how this works.

Limitations:  There is no event scheduling in the server. SC needs timing info for this as OF does not expose time stamps for audio buffers.

How it works: A variant of libscsynth was built from the SuperCollider source, with the following changes:
(1) -DSC_AUDIO_API=SC_AUDIO_API_AUDIOUNITS was added to the 'Other c-flags' configuration.
(2) '_AUCallback' was added to the list of exports in libscsynth_exp.
This static library is included in this repository as 'libsynthAU.a'
